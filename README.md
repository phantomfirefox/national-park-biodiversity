## Scope

### Understanding the Problem

Currently more than 40,000 species in the world face the threat of extinction with over 140,000 endangered or crtitcally endangered species. According to the IUCN Red List, of these are:
* 41% Amphibians 🐸
* 26% Mammals 🐒
* 34% Conifers 🌲
* 13% Birds 🐦
* 37% Sharks and Rays 🐟
* 33% Reef Coral 🪨
* 28% Crustaceans 🦀
* 21% Reptiles 🦎

### Goals

Provide detail analysis on species and trend or themes to the types of species that become endangered. Detailed anaylsis can provide ways to identify species and provide support in selected habitats and ecosystems.

### Actions

This analysis will potentially inform National Parks to prevent possible extinction of endangered species.
